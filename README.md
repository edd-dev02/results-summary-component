## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM Methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

**“I improved my ability to structure HTML elements and apply classes correctly using the BEM methodology. I also refreshed my CSS skills by implementing Grid and Flexbox, and reinforced my knowledge of gradients.

The main challenge was the Desktop view, as I initially used several unnecessary containers in my HTML structure. After some refactoring, the final result turned out quite close to the original design.”**
